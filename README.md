# TensorFlow-Developer-Exam-Prep

General: A collection of notebooks I've created for the purpose of practicing  and studying for the TF Developer Exam.

This repository has been created for the purposes of compiling various practice notebooks I've completed in anticipation of taking the TF exam in April '23. For anyone looking for examples of particular ML problems, the repo will include the following problem domains sooner or later, if it doesn't already:

1. Neural Net Regression
2. Binary Classification
3. Multi-class Categorization
4. Binary Image Classification
5. Multi-class Image Categorization
6. Transfer Learning (Feature Extraction & Fine-Tuning)
7. Natural Language Processing:
  - Binary Classification
  - Multi-class Categorization
  - Text Generation
8. Time Series Analysis and Prediction

I hope anyone else who plans on studying for and taking the Exam finds these notebooks helpful.
